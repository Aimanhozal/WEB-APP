## 📝 YOUR COMMENT TEMPLATES FEATURE

**This is your KEY innovation to highlight:**

From **CODE_WALKTHROUGH.md**:
```python
COMMENT_TEMPLATES = {
    "Introduction": [
        {"score": 5, "text": "Excellent introduction..."},
        {"score": 4, "text": "Good introduction..."},
        ...
    ]
}
```

**Why it's important:**
- Teachers write similar comments over and over
- Templates save 30-40% of evaluation time
- Ensures consistent, quality feedback
- Still customizable if teacher wants to edit

**How to demo it:**
1. Show dropdown menu for a category
2. Click to reveal template options
3. Select one
4. Watch both score AND comment auto-fill
5. Show how progress ring updates
6. Explain teacher can edit both if needed
