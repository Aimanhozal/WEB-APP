*From EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md - MEMORIZE THIS:*

"VibeCoding is a web application that makes student project evaluation fast and enjoyable. Instead of using boring spreadsheets, teachers simply select pre-written comment templates for each grading category, and the system automatically generates professional PDF reports with grades. It has 12 grading categories worth 70 points total, and the comment templates save teachers 30-40% of their typing time. Built with Python Flask on the backend, modern JavaScript on the frontend, and containerized with Docker for easy deployment. This demonstrates complete full-stack web development skills."
